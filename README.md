# Hey!

It's been some time since I was able to commit something, and the time was filled with some professional challenges that I needed to tackle before I could get back to coding.

As a short reprieve from HTML/CSS/JS/React/Redux, I had an idea to create a simple to-do app with the use of Flet, Python, and SQLite. 

## Capabilities available for now:
- initialise database with dummy tasks (name, description, time created, due date, urgency, and priority)
- add new tasks
- remove tasks
- modify already added tasks
- theme colour changes - for now 7 colors

## Work in progress (available in the future):
- dark/light theme
- different views for tasks
- task categories
- font type and size change
- notifications
- date format change

It's been a lot of fun to write this little thing, so I'm gonna continue on. I'm happy to accept suggestions for changes and potential bugs that emerge.
